## Contributing to ServicesDAO

All contributions to this repository are considered to be licensed under MIT License.

Workflow for bug fixes:
* Check open issues and unmerged pull requests to make sure the topic is not already covered elsewhere
* Fork the repository
* Do your changes on your fork
* Make sure to add or update relevant test cases
* Create a pull request, with a suitable title and description, referring to the related issue


### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the ServicesDAO project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin](https://github.com/EKON-YAZILIM/ServicesDAO/blob/master/.github/developer-certificate-of-origin).
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
